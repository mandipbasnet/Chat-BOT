#AI Chatbot Using TensorFlow

Introduction

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using TensorFlow, designed to handle various user queries. It employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to inputs, making conversations with the bot feel more natural.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow

Numpy

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

JSON (for handling intents)

Pickle (for saving models)

Install the required libraries with:

pip install tensorflow numpy nltk

Project Structure

intents.json: Contains the dataset of intents, patterns, and responses.

chatbot.py: Core script to train and run the chatbot.

train.py: Script to train the model.

model.h5: Trained model file.

README.md: Project documentation.

How It Works

Data Preprocessing:

Load the intents.json file to get training data.

Tokenize sentences and lemmatize words to reduce complexity.

Model Training:

Create a neural network with TensorFlow.

Train the model with the processed data.

Response Generation:

Take user input, preprocess it, and predict the intent.

Return a suitable response from the intents file.

Example Intents.json

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey!"]
    }
  ]
}

Running the Project

Train the Model:

python train.py

Run the Chatbot:

python chatbot.py

Interact with the Chatbot:

You: Hello
Bot: Hi there!

Future Improvements

Enhance the intent dataset.

Implement a GUI for better user interaction.

Integrate with external APIs for dynamic responses.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates building a simple AI chatbot using TensorFlow and NLP techniques. It covers essential concepts like data preprocessing, model training, and response generation.

Happy Chatting! ðŸ¤–
